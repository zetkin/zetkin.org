To develop useful software and methods for the movement we need different perspectives to meet. We offer a space to collaborate and exchange ideas – both within and across fields. 
For this community meetup, we invite

- Organizers and movement builders
- Software developers and designers
- Data analysts 

Expect a weekend with both interdisciplinary workshops and time for practical things like project planning, coding, designing and researching together. We will also put in time to develop the Zetkin plattform. On top of that: fun, food, discussions and socialism. 

How can we improve our organizing and what tools to we need? Meet the organizers who have first hand experience of organizing rallies, strikes and campaigns that impacts society.

In what ways can software be used for organizing? Meet the software developers and designers involved in the Zetkin platform who have the technical perspective and skills to create software for organizing.

How can we measure the effects of our organizing efforts? Talk do the data analysts from the Zetkin community, who knows how to analyze and present the results of our strategies.

Would like to document this event so our community can grow ? We also have a need for volunteers who are photographers, videographers, social media content producers and writers/journalists. 

When? 3-5 October, 2025
