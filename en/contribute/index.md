We welcome all contributions to the development of Zetkin. Regardless of
whether you can donate funds or time we gratefully accept your contribution.

## Volunteer
Zetkin is developed, documented, taught and communicated in large part by volunteers.
If you possess knowledge that could be of use in a large-scale web project like
Zetkin, please feel welcome to join our project.

Zetkin is large and professional web project based on modern technologies. Large
parts of the project are open-source. We organize bi-weekly hackathons in Malm√∂,
Sweden to work together. Does it sound interesting?
