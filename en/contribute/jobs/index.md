    We are always looking to grow our team of people that believe in the Zetkin
    project and want to contribute.

Zetkin is a web based platform for organizing activism using tools that make
participation easier and simplify common tasks in activist organizations.

Zetkin Foundation is a part of Vänsterpartiet Malmö, in charge of developing
Zetkin and spreading successful organizing methods throughout the international
left.

Most of the people doing work in Zetkin Foundation are volunteers, but there is
also a core team of part-time designers and developers, and over the next few
years we want to grow that team.

## Are you a mobile developer?
One of our products is a mobile app developed using Flutter, and we think that
someone with mobile expertise could help us take the next step in improving
that product. Please reach out of you have experience developing mobile
applications and are familiar with or willing to learn Flutter.


## Are you a senior web developer?
Our development team has grown a lot in the past two years and we would like
to add one more senior developer. As a senior developer at Zetkin Foundation,
you will need to be (or become) comfortable with at least some of the following:

* Next.js and React
* Fullstack development using Typescript
* Frontend testing (unit, component, e2e)
* Python for server development
* Open-source management practices (code reviews, documentation etc)
* Docker and devops

It's also great if you have experience pair programming and mentoring more
junior developers, and if you are comfortable improving processes whenever
possible, or stepping in when process is less than ideal.

## Let's define the role together
In the end, what we need more than anything is someone who's dedicated. Whether
you are a junior fresh out of school, a capable hobbyist or an experienced
senior, we're interested in hearing from you. It's not important whether your
primary skills are design, front-end or back-end development, mobile or web.

For us the most important thing is to find people who shares our progressive
ideas and can learn what's necessary. We can define the role together based on
some common principles:

* Everyone at Zetkin Foundation have the same salary, which is higher than a
  typical Swedish junior salary, but lower than a senior
* Everyone at Zetkin Foundation work part-time
* We have a distributed team who works mostly remotely, and our working
  language is English

Please get in touch if you want to contribute to empowering progressive
organizations. Send us an e-mail at [info@zetkin.org](mailto:info@zetkin.org).

## Contribute some other way?
If the listings above are a bad fit, but you still want to contribute to Zetkin,
please let us know! There is always room for more volunteers, regardless of
what your skills and preferences are. If you have a brand new idea, let us know!
