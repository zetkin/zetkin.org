## We are looking for a developer to join our team!

Zetkin is a web based platform for organizing activism using tools that make participation easier and simplify common tasks in activist organizations. In addition to a team of paid workers, we work with around 100 contributing volunteer coders, designers and more. Zetkin Foundation, part of Vänsterpartiet Malmö, is in charge of developing Zetkin and spreading successful organizing methods throughout the international left.

## Who are we in the software team?

We are a small team that work close together, even though we don’t sit in the same room. We collaborate a lot, give and receive feedback a lot, and spend a lot of time defining and refining our methods and ideas. Accessible code that's easy to read is important for us, which means we probably spend more time than most on making sure we produce sustainable, self-documenting code. The methods we use to structure our work involves shared responsibility for planning and goal-setting. We care about each other, and we have all worked here for multiple years.

### Some tools we use (you don't have to know all, we'll teach you what you need):

- Next.js & React (frontend development)
- TypeScript (full-stack development)
- Frontend testing (unit, component, end-to-end)
- Python (server-side development)
- Open-source collaboration (code reviews, documentation, etc.)
- Docker & DevOps
- Flutter (mobile app development)

## So, what do we look for?

What we want the most is someone who is dedicated. Whether you are a junior fresh out of school, a capable hobbyist or an experienced senior, we’re interested in hearing from you. It’s not important whether your primary skills are front-end or back-end development, mobile or web. For us the most important thing is to find people who share our progressive ideas and can learn what’s necessary for the job.

### In addition, we hope that...

- You have some years or many years experience working as a developer
- The idea of working part-time for a radical leftist organisation sounds great to you
- You care about writing and maintaining code that is accessible and easy to read.
- You are happy about the idea of both sharing your knowledge and learning from others.
- You can work daytime hours with a team based in CET timezone
- You are comfortable using English as your work language

Important to know is that everyone at Zetkin Foundation works part-time, and everyone has the same salary. The pay is more than the typical salary for a junior, but less than a typical salary for a senior.

Send your application to [work@zetkin.org](mailto:work@zetkin.org), we look forward to hearing from you!
